  // executor looked up the external channel by an EVM-derived `tokenId`, which

  // NEW channel and the Solana settle tx failed with #5508010 (fee-payer not a
  // TransactionSendingSigner). 3.9.3 resolves the channel by the correct
  // programId-keyed identifier so the full Solana on-chain settle
  // (CLAIM_FROM_CHANNEL + SETTLE_CHANNEL) executes. Builds on 3.9.2's Mina
  // settlement-side proof-encoding fix (#90), 3.9.1's #88 fix (SettlementExecutor
  // resolves the settlement chain for dynamic anonymous HS peers), and 3.9.1's
  // blockchain-typed inbound claim validation (validateClaimMessage switches on
  // claim.blockchain → validateEVMClaim / validateSolanaClaim / validateMinaClaim).
  // validateSolanaClaim accepts { blockchain:'solana', programId, channelAccount
  // (base58), nonce, transferredAmount, signature, signerPublicKey (base58),
  // cluster? }. No breaking changes to the SDK/admin contract within 3.x (verified
  // >=3.3.2 through 3.9.3 — see packages/sdk/CONNECTOR_MIGRATION.md). Digest
  // resolved via `docker buildx imagetools inspect` for tag 3.9.3 (manifest-index
  // digest). To bump: see CONNECTOR_RELEASE_CONTRACT.md.
